Five Types of Kubernetes Application Deployment Strategies:

âœ… Recreate Deployment
ðŸ‘‰ A recreate deployment strategy is an all-or-nothing process that lets you update an application immediately, with some downtime
ðŸ‘‰ In this type of very simple deployment, all of the old pods are killed all at once and get replaced all at once with the new ones.
ðŸ‘‰ A recreate strategy is suitable for development environments, or when users prefer a short period of downtime.
ðŸ‘‰ At one time, only a single version of application will be running.

âœ… Rolling (Ramped) Deployment
ðŸ‘‰ The rolling deployment is the standard default deployment to Kubernetes.
ðŸ‘‰ It works by slowly, one by one, replacing pods of the previous version of your application with pods of the new version without any cluster downtime.
ðŸ‘‰ The advantages of a rolling deployment are that it is relatively easy to roll back, is less risky than a recreate deployment, and is easier to implement.

âœ… Blue/Green (Red/Black) Deployment
ðŸ‘‰ In a blue/green deployment strategy (sometimes referred to as red/black) the old version of the application (blue) and the new version (green) get deployed at the same time. 
ðŸ‘‰ A blue/green (or red/black) deployment strategy enables you to deploy a new version while avoiding downtime. 
ðŸ‘‰ When both of these are deployed, users only have access to the blue; whereas, the green is available to your QA team for test automation on a separate service or via direct port-forwarding.
ðŸ‘‰ This strategy requires double resources for both deployments and can incur high costs. 

âœ… Canary Deployment
ðŸ‘‰ A canary deployment strategy enables you to test a new application version on a real user base without committing to a full rollout. It involves using a progressive delivery model that initiates a phased deployment. 
ðŸ‘‰ Typically, a canary strategy gradually deploys a new application version to the Kubernetes cluster, testing it on a small amount of live traffic (small subset of live users). 
ðŸ‘‰ While this deploy strategy can be done just using Kubernetes resources by replacing old and new pods, it is much more convenient and easier to implement this strategy with a service mesh like Istio.

âœ… A/B Testing Deployment
ðŸ‘‰ A/B testing refers to canary deployments that distribute traffic to different versions of an application based on certain parameters.
ðŸ‘‰ A typical canary deployment routes users based on traffic weights, whereas A/B testing can target specific users based on cookies, user agents, or other parameters.
