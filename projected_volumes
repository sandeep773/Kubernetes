You might have used Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes but have you heard of "Projected Volumes" 🤔

✅ A Projected Volume maps several existing volume sources into the same directory.

✅ All sources are required to be in the same namespace as the Pod.

✅ As of now, Projected volumes in Kubernetes supports following types of volume sources :

1️⃣ secret
👉 You can put the secrets at a specified path in the directory specified for the projected volume.

2️⃣ downwardAPI
👉 A downwardAPI volume makes downward API data available to applications. Within the volume, you can find the exposed data as read-only files in plain text format.
👉 A container using the downward API as a subPath volume mount does not receive updates when field values change.
👉 Using Projected volumes for downwardAPI will receive updates.

3️⃣ configMap
👉 A ConfigMap provides a way to inject configuration data into pods.
👉 The data stored in a ConfigMap can be referenced in a volume of type configMap and then consumed by containerized applications running in a pod.

4️⃣ serviceAccountToken
👉 You can inject the token for the current service account into a Pod at a specified path.
👉 Containers in this Pod can use that token to access the Kubernetes API server, authenticating with the identity of the pod's ServiceAccount.

✅ A container using a projected volume source as a subPath volume mount will not receive updates for those volume sources.
