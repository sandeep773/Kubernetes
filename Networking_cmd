ifconfig -a : this will show all the network interfaces.
cat /etc/network/interfaces :  this will show all the network interfaces.(Physical interface)
ip link : this will show all physical links.

Q. what is the IP address assign to the master node on this interface ? 
Ans : ip link : this will get the eth3(2 value)
      ifconfig eth3 : this will give ip address.
      
      
 Q. what is the mac address of the of the interface on master node ? 
 Ans. ip link : this will give output >> ens3 >> mac address will be after the link/ether (b4:45:06:61:0e:31)
 
 Q. what is the IP address assigned to node01 ? 
 
Ans.  ssh node01 ifconfig ens3 : this will ssh to node01 and will give output (inet 172.17.20.0)

Q. what is the mac address assigned to node 01 ? 

Ans. ssh node01 ifconfig ens3 : (ether b4:45:06:61:0e:31).

Q. We use docker as our container runtime what is the interface/bridge created by docker on this host ? 

Ans. ssh node01 ifconfig -a : docker 0

Q. What is the state of interface docker0 ? 

Ans. ssh node01 ip link : check for docker0 interface up or down. 

Q. if you ping google.com from master node, which route does it take? what is the IP address of default gateway ? 

Ans. ip r  OR ip route  : 

Q. what is the port the kube scheduler is listning on in the master node ? 

Ans. netstat -natulp | grep kube-scheduler

Q. Notice that ETCD is listining on two ports. which of these have more count client connection established ? 

Ans. netstat -natulp | grep etcd | grep LISTEN

Q. What is the networking solution used by this cluster ? 

Ans. ps aux | grep kubelet  >>> this will show output cni 
     ls /etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conflist
     
 Q. How many weave agents /peers are deployed in this cluster ? 
 
 Ans. kubectl get nodes -n kube-system
 
 Q. on which node the weave peer present ? 
 
 Ans. kubectl get nodes -n kube-system -o wide 
 
=== k exec imagename --ip route   OR     k exec imagename --route -n   >>>> will show default gateway route
