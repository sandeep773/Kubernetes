Have you heard of "DownwardAPI" in Kubernetes?
If not, then Let's see how to use this in Kubernetes 👇

✅ What is DownwardAPI?
👉 The downward API allows containers to consume information about themselves or the cluster without using the Kubernetes client or API server.
👉 It is sometimes useful for a container to have information about itself, without being overly coupled to Kubernetes.
👉 Example: Suppose you want the Pod's name as an environment variable in the container. DownwardAPI in kubernetes help us to get that information easily.

✅ How to expose Pod and container fields to a running container?
There are 2 ways:

1️⃣ As environment variables
👉 You can inject the required information as environment variable in the container using the "fieldRef".
👉 Refer the image for an example.
👉 You can try it yourself by following the steps provided at https://lnkd.in/gXPzzPzN

2️⃣ As files in a downwardAPI volume
👉 Instead of using environment variables, you can also write the required info into file(s) using the DownwardAPI Volume feature.
👉 Check the example in the image with this post.
👉 You can try it yourself by following the steps provided at https://lnkd.in/gefpHsBE

✍ Let me know in comments what all info you would want to pass to the containers using this feature.
