💁‍♂️ Three Types of Kubernetes Probes (Health Checks) You Must Know in Detail:

✅ Readiness Probe
✅ Liveness Probe
✅ Startup Probe

✴ Kubernetes Probes are used to detect:
👉 Containers that haven’t started yet and can’t serve traffic.
👉 Containers that are overwhelmed and can’t serve additional traffic.
👉 Containers that are completely dead and not serving any traffic.


✅ Liveness Probe
👉 It indicates whether the container is running inside a pod
👉 If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy.
👉 If a container does not provide a liveness probe, the default state is Success.
👉 If app is healthy, Kubernetes will not interfere with pod functioning. If app is unhealthy, Pod will be marked as unhealthy. If a Pod fails health-checks continuously, the Kubernetes terminates the pod and starts a new one.


✅ Readiness Probe
👉 It indicates whether the container is ready to respond to requests.
👉 Readiness probes let Kubernetes know when your app (running in a container inside Pod) is ready to serve traffic.
👉 If the readiness probe fails, the endpoints controller removes the Pod's IP address from the endpoints of all Services that match the Pod. 
👉 Unlike a liveness probe, a readiness probe doesn’t kill the container. If the readiness probe fails, Kubernetes simply hides the container’s Pod from corresponding Services, so that no traffic is redirected to it.
👉 A side-effect of using Readiness Probes is that they can increase the time it takes to update Deployments.


✅ Startup Probe
👉 It indicates whether the application within the container is started.
👉 Startup probe has higher priority over the two other probe types. All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided, until it succeeds.
👉 If the startup probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy.
👉Startup probes are useful in situations where your app can take a long time to start, or could occasionally fail on startup.
