👉 10 most common reasons for a kubernetes deployment failure summarized and explained by Ross Kukulinski in 2017 which are still relevant:

🔸 Wrong Container Image or Invalid Registry Permissions
🔸 Application Crashing after Launch
🔸 Missing ConfigMap or Secret
🔸 Liveness/Readiness Probe Failure
🔸 Exceeding CPU/Memory Limits
🔸 Resource Quotas
🔸 Insufficient Cluster Resources
🔸 PersistentVolume fails to mount
🔸 Validation Errors (Invalid Yaml or invalid entries in the spec)
🔸 Container Image Not Updating (due to ImagePullPolicy)

Most of the deployment failures can be debugged by using the following commands:

✍ kubectl describe deployment/<deployname>
✍ kubectl describe replicaset/<rsname>
✍ kubectl get pods
✍ kubectl describe pod/<podname>
✍ kubectl logs <podname> --previous
