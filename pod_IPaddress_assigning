How does a Pod in #Kubernetes cluster gets an IP address 🤔☸

Setting up #Networking on a #k8s cluster is essentially the interaction between 𝑲𝒖𝒃𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒕 <=> 𝑪𝑵𝑰 (Container Networking Interface) <=> 𝑪𝑹𝑰 (Container Runtime Interface) 🚀

Let's break down the steps between the service calls !!

👉 Kube-controller-manager assigns a podCIDR to each node in the cluster
👉 Pods on a node are assigned an IP address from the subnet value in podCIDR.
👉 Because podCIDRs across all nodes are disjoint subnets, it allows assigning each pod a unique IP address.
👉 #k8s cluster administrator configures and installs kubelet, #container runtime, network provider agent and distributes #CNI plugins on each node.
👉 When a network provider agent starts, it generates a CNI config.
👉 When a pod is scheduled on a node, kubelet calls the #CRI plugin to create the pod on the node assigned
👉 The CNI plugin specified in the CNI config configures the pod network resulting in a pod getting an IP address !!
