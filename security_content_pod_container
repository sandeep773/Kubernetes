Are you configuring "Security Context" for your pods in your Kubernetes infrastructure?

ðŸ‘‰ A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container.

There are many security context settings, however, according to Ian Lewis, here are 3 settings which must be applied to all the pods:

âœ… runAsUser: 1000
ðŸ‘‰ The runAsUser field specifies that for any Containers in the Pod.
ðŸ‘‰ If this field is omitted, the primary group ID of the containers will be root(0).
ðŸ‘‰ This must be set to any non-zero value to avoid running any process as root and thus security risk will be very low

âœ… readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
ðŸ‘‰ It mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only.
ðŸ‘‰ An immutable root filesystem can prevent malicious binaries being added to PATH and it's execution
ðŸ‘‰ Immutable filesystems will prevent your application writing to disk.
ðŸ‘‰ If there is any requirement to store any files to disk, then emptyDir volume or a persistent volumes can be attached to the pod.

âœ… allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
ðŸ‘‰ It controls whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process. 
ðŸ‘‰ It directly controls whether the "no_new_privs" flag gets set on the container process.
ðŸ‘‰ It is always true when the container:
ðŸ”¹ is run as privileged, or
ðŸ”¹ has CAP_SYS_ADMIN

ðŸ‘‹ There are many such settings which can be set to secure your pods. You can check them out here: https://lnkd.in/gHMj2Rnv
