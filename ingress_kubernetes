Types of Ingress in Kubernetes 👇

1️⃣ Ingress backed by a single Service
👉 An Ingress with a default backend with no rules
👉 The defaultBackend will comprise of a single service and port.

2️⃣ Simple fanout 
👉 A fanout configuration routes traffic from a single IP address to more than one Service.
👉 The routing is based on the HTTP URI being requested.
👉 For example, example.com/foo and example.com/bar , traffic for both can be routed to different services by using an ingress.

3️⃣ Name based virtual hosting 
👉 Name-based virtual hosts support routing HTTP traffic to multiple host names at the same IP address.
👉 An ingress can route traffic to two different services for example1.com and example2.com using an ingress.

4️⃣ TLS
👉 TLS ingress is used to secure an ingress using the certificates for the hosts.
👉  The Ingress resource only supports a single TLS port 443.
👉  TLS termination happens at the ingress point and traffic to the Service ( and its Pods) will be in plaintext.
